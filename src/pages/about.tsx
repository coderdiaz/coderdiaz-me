        <h2 className="text-xl md:text-2.5xl font-bold font-inter mb-4 dark:text-white">Brief history</h2>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">
          I started software development with sill in high school, after being introduced by a friend. My first programs were written using C, Visual Basic and C++. I attend the collage at the Instituto Tecnologico de Lazaro Cardenas (ITLAC) and study the degree in Computer System Engineering.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">
          In 2015, I get my first job in the Port of Lazaro Cardenas (APILAC) as a Web Developer working with Laravel, Vue and other technologies. Here, I obtained the motivation for teamwork and professional development of the teams I worked with and thus achieve to perform as a technical leader and in a future CTO.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">
          In 2017, I travel to Mexico City to work in a Startup called <a className="border-b-2 border-gray-200 transition duration-200 ease-in-out hover:border-gray-400" href="https://pulpomatic.com">Pulpomatic</a>, a SaaS for fleet management, reduce costs and save time in management tasks. I was working in the migration from a older dashboard using a Monolitic archicture to better approach using services. Same year, I left Pulpomatic to join a Mexico-based digital media publisher called <a className="border-b-2 border-gray-200 transition duration-200 ease-in-out hover:border-gray-400" href="https://pulpomatic.com">Cultura Colectiva</a>. It publishes content designed to be shared over social media networks targeted at a Latin American audience.
        </p>
        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-10 dark:text-gray-100">
          For 2019, I was looking for new challenges and I joined the <a className="border-b-2 border-gray-200 transition duration-200 ease-in-out hover:border-gray-400" href="https://bedu.org">BEDU</a> team, first as an Mentor in the Web Development Bootcamp and later as a Technical Leader in Software Engineering. Months later, I was invited to collaborate in the creation of a course in Platzi called <a className="border-b-2 border-gray-200 transition duration-200 ease-in-out hover:border-gray-400" href="https://platzi.com/cursos/vuejs-avanzado/">Advanced Vuejs</a> which I had the pleasure of recording at Platzi HQ in Bogota, Colombia.

        <p className="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4 dark:text-gray-100">

          My favorite libraries and frameworks are Vue, React, Nest.js, Next.js, Gatsby and Echo.
